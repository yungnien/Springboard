    "In the beginning,  three project proposals were required, via searching for possible data sets, several [possible data sources were identified](https://github.com/yungnien/Springboard/blob/master/capstone/Capstone%20ideas.ipynb), and later narrow down to [three candidate topics](https://github.com/yungnien/Springboard/blob/master/capstone/Capstone%20ideas%20v2.ipynb). The mentor recommends selecting NLP project based on popularity and resource constrain as image processing will require significant computation resources that might not be available for free. The proposal was submitted and been approved. \n"

    "although the primary data is question sentences that do not require feature engineering,  the basic data cleaning step has been applied and tested, including removing accented & foreign characters, expanding contractions, case unification, stemming, lemmatization and stop word removing.  The latter three did not been applied to the final modeling comparison for data consistency reason. \n",
